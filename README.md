# Fire&smoke Detection

Wildfires serve as a stark reminder of nature’s raw power, often resulting in ecological
devastation, displacement of wildlife and property damage. Large-scale
fires have a huge impact on human civilization either economically, environmentally,
or health-wise and, with the increase of the global warming crisis, it
is becoming a growing problem in a large number of countries. The project’s main objective consists of using high-resolution images taken
of regions (rural and urban) that are possibly being affected by a fire and trying
to detect if there is any smoke and/or fire in the image while also predicting the
region of the image that has them. In order to complete the task at hand it’s
being proposed the usage of a state-of-the-art YOLO-NAS model for object detection. Recognizing a lot more work has to be done before the model becomes production ready this serves as an introductory attempt to use deep learning as a preventive wildfire intervention tool.
